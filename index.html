<h2> Welcome to my site! </h2>

<!-- image of a duck -->

<p> I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why... </p>

<h3>HTML is cool </h3>
<h3>CSS is cooler</h3>
<h3>JS is the best</h3>

<h2> What do you need to create a website? </h2>

<p>Not much!</p>
  <ol>
<li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
<li>A text editor (i am using atom)</li>
<li>A web browser (I am using chrom)</li>
<li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>

<h2>Follow my progress on github</h2>
